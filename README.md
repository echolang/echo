# Echo Programming Language

Echo is a statically typed, natively compiled, general-purpose programming language.

Welcome to my highly opinionated and far from production-ready version of PHP that goes brrrr.

Echo takes a lot of inspiration from modern PHP. However, to be clear, you cannot simply write PHP code and expect it to work. Echo has some fundamental differences but is designed to be easily picked up by PHP developers.
